        Ghana is a democratic republic in West Africa, located on the Gulf of
        Guinea, and the first sub-Saharan African nation to gain independence in
        1957. With diverse landscapes including coastal plains, tropical
        rainforests, and savannah, it boasts the world's largest artificial
        lake, Lake Volta. The nation maintains a multi-party system, has
        significant freedom of speech and the press, and its official language
        is English, though many indigenous languages are also spoken.
